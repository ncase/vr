    <!--Hey there ncase! My name is Michael Huff and I am a developer here in the bay area.-->
    <!--I've made a pull request because I figured it was a better way than email for one dev to contact another.-->
    <!--I just played through "Coming out simulator 2014", "Tale of the Polygons", and "Nothing to Hide". -->
    <!--These were all absolutely phenomenal games.-->
    <!--I was very moved when I made it through COS2014. It reminded me exactly how powerful a game can be in the -->
    <!--art of storytelling. It's also great that you've made these games about subjects that are so personal to -->
    <!--your own story and your passions. You are doing an incredible job of being self actealized in the things you-->
    <!--are creating. It's even better that you are open sourcing it to the world to work with. Like you said in a-->
    <!--post: by giving up power over your art, you make your art more powerful. This is rightly evidenced by polygons-es-->
    <!--I've already made a grafitti mapping app for android and helped with Selfies4Reform-->
    
    <!--I was also very happy to discover that you'd made some excellent games on newgrounds in the past. Game design-->
    <!--that breaks your normal concept of a game has always been something I've sought out.-->

    <!--I am currently going through a change in my career with regards to what I can focus on. I find myself wanting -->
    <!--more creative fulfillment in the projects I'm involved in(previously mobile work) and I think web dev will make-->
    <!--that much more available to me. I know you're very busy with everything that's going on at the moment, but I'd-->
    <!--love to pick your brain about your process for project direction/execution and, frankly, just talk to someone-->
    <!--whose art aligns so much with what I'd hope to create in the world. I will also soon be talking with Josh Carpenter-->
    <!--at Mozilla. His projects about 3D web pages seem fascinating to me.-->
    <!--I'm open to most forms of communication: email threads, gchat, coffee/lunch somewhere(my treat), morse code, etc.-->
    <!--However, I draw the line at semaphor. Ain't nobody got time for that.-->
    <!--Closing, I'd just like to reiterate keep being awesome. You've done a really good job at it so far.-->
    <!--Cheers,-->
    <!--M-->
    <!--or @koalahamlet on all the things-->
    
    <!--Forgot to add this in the first commit, but I remember you posting a question about places to receive funding.-->
    <!--Gratipay, formerly Git Tip, is a place where people can donate a set amount to a specific person monthly.-->
    <!--Maybe something you'd like to look into setting up an account at to receive funding?-->
